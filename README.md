<h3>Read first: <a href="https://sphinx-demon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Documentation</a></h3>

## Features

* High-powered Platform
With characteristics of multitasking, security, multithread, micro kernel, etc., QuecOpen transparently manages all LTE related activities to allow developers to natively execute C, C++ and shell script based program on the processor and in the memory of Quectel modules
* Fast Development
QuecOpen SDK provides rich small examples, which enables developers to realize fast development. Supporting C-based runtime libraries offers more flexibility for developers to design software and program
* More Competitive
By directly downloading the embedded applications to Quectel modules to run, it is now possible to remove external host processor, memory, and a range of product specific ASICs such as IO expanders, audio DSPs, and many other analogue and digital devices.

## Requirements
